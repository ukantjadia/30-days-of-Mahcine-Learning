```python
DataFrame.col_name.median()
```
- this is used to find the median of values in col_name
-  To find unique in col_name : `DataFrame.col_name.unique()` 
 To count the unique values: `DataFrame.col_name.value_counts()`
- Centering: this `'centering'` transformation is a common preprocessing step before applying various machine learning algorithms
 `centered_price = reviews['price']- reviews.price.mean()`
 - You and use the `DataFrame.apply()` is used to apply the function on the rows with axis
