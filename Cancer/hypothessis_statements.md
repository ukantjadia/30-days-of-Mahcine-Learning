## and also give me all possible hypothesis which i can make in my this project

Here are a few possible hypotheses that you could explore in your data science project on deaths due to lung cancer caused by smoking:

-    Smoking is a significant contributor to lung cancer deaths: You could explore this hypothesis by analyzing the relationship between smoking and lung cancer deaths. You could look at the number of deaths due to lung cancer among smokers compared to non-smokers, and examine how this relationship changes over time and across different populations.

-    The rate of lung cancer deaths is higher in certain populations: You could explore this hypothesis by examining the demographic characteristics of individuals who die from lung cancer, such as age, gender, race, and socioeconomic status. You could look for patterns in the data that suggest that certain populations are more at risk of dying from lung cancer.

-    Early detection and treatment can reduce the number of deaths from lung cancer: You could explore this hypothesis by analyzing the relationship between the stage at which lung cancer is diagnosed and the likelihood of survival. You could look at the survival rates of individuals who are diagnosed with early-stage lung cancer compared to those who are diagnosed with late-stage lung cancer.

-    Certain lifestyle factors, such as diet and exercise, can reduce the risk of dying from lung cancer: You could explore this hypothesis by examining the relationship between lifestyle factors and lung cancer deaths. You could look at the number of deaths due to lung cancer among individuals who have certain lifestyle habits, such as those who exercise regularly or follow a healthy diet.

-    The availability of effective treatments for lung cancer can reduce the number of deaths: You could explore this hypothesis by examining the relationship between the availability of treatments for lung cancer and the number of deaths due to the disease. You could look at the number of deaths due to lung cancer in areas where effective treatments are available compared to areas where they are not.

-    The use of tobacco products other than cigarettes is associated with lung cancer deaths: You could explore this hypothesis by examining the relationship between the use of tobacco products, such as cigars and pipes, and lung cancer deaths. You could look at the number of deaths due to lung cancer among individuals who use these products compared to those who do not.

These are just a few examples of hypotheses that you could explore in your project. Depending on the specific goals of your project and the data that you have available, you may want to consider other hypotheses as well.
